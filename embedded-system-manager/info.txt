Bash script intended to be run on Debian-based systems.
It automates the process of updating system packages, cloning/pulling a Git repository, and executing a specified file from the repository on startup.
The script is designed to simplify deployments by managing configuration, package updates, and script execution with minimal manual intervention.

This script runs on startup using a systemd service located at /etc/systemd/system/embedded-device-deployer.service
